# Async-landing project
## Landing page exercise - Platzi

This is a pretty nice project made with HTML, tailwind and vanilla JS.

I practiced here API consumption, Youtube API and async/await for asynchronous calls to APIs.


This is the the project of the [this course](https://platzi.com/cursos/asincronismo-js/)

I hope you like it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/async-landing/)!
